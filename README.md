# Movie-Ratings-Prediction

## Overview
The assignment involves implementing a collaborative filtering algorithm from scratch on the MovieLens 1M Dataset to predict movie ratings for different users. We explored on different optimization methods such as naive gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, alternated minimization etc. We also explored on other recommendation system approach such as the Memory-based approach.
